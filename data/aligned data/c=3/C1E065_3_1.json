Eventually, Vex's group finds a soothsayer with a deck of cards. Paying him for his services, he answers their three questions for five gold each, the questions being about a garment that they are searching for, about the individual who possesses said garment, and about what they should know about the conflict they are moving towards and what they should be prepared for:\n The soothsayer puts away his cards and returns to his meditative stance, eating his apple, but as they leave:\n Seemingly satisfied with the reading, Vex says her farewell to the soothsayer and rejoins the others as they all head to the Shade, albeit Scanlan is still absent.",
