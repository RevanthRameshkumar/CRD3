At the same time Uriel, going through a bit of an emotional breakdown with his lack of leadership in this whole circumstance, it was discovered that the reason his defense was improper was because there was an individual on the actual Council who was a traitor, who had been working with the Briarwoods and was secretly a follower of Vecna, from what the documents seemed to say.",
