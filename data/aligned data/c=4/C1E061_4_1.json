Their recent journey has brought them into the Feywild, a pseudo-parallel plane of fey magic, chaos, and all sorts of \"goodness\" in-between.

After a faithful re-meeting with the parents of Vex and Vax, discussions were had, hats were attempted to be stolen [from] the leader of the city —and successfully done so.",
