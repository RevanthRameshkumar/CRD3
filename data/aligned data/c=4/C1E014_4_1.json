So they've come back to Emon, they've come to their keep, Greyskull Keep, they've had an evening of rest. Upon waking the next morning, they've managed to get some breakfast, they've freed Lady Kima from her stone entrapment, as she was turned to stone during the battle with the beholder, and had a conversation based around what should or could be done about this Horn of Orcus, this evil artifact.\"",
