So upon meeting them, a vengeance urge kicked up within Percival, the rest of the party following him to Whitestone to attempt to free the city from the clutches of the very, very, seemingly evil—and in some cases undead—Briarwoods, as Lord Briarwood appears to be vampiric in nature. \"After arriving they had some stealth missions, they went around, discovered a fair warning on the Sun Tree —one of the central items of Whitestone, a relic of Pelor from long ago that the city was built around—now dead and holding a series of bodies hung from it, all dressed and painted to look like members of Vox Machina. While they were here they managed to find and hole up in an abandoned tavern, closing the windows off, and after doing a little bit of digging spoke to the head of the Lady's Chamber, the temple to Erathis, to which Percival and most of the team seemed to be interested in starting a rebellion within Whitestone.",
