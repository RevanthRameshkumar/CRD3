After saving her, they discovered that there was an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface. There was an illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'Voril deeper within this cavern structure, and currently the elder brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as K'Varn, who they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many, many, hundreds upon hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his avatars. Somehow it found its way to this beholder and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole.\n\"The party fought their way through, made a few allies including the ousted mind flayer Clarota, seeking to return to his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save. Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the temple in the center of the city, and, using a Polymorphed\n fomorian giant cascading hundreds upon hundreds of feet through the glass structure on top, managed to break their way into the temple. After which a very dangerous battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A number of very close calls, they managed to take him out, using Tiberius' Telekinesis tore the horn from its forehead, and the beholder fell to the ground, unmoving, and finally killed as opposed to its undead form.\"\n"

As they do, Clarota turns on the party with a mind blast that sends Pike and Scanlan reeling. Vex'ahlia retaliates by attacking the Elder Brain and is joined in that effort by the rest of the party. Keyleth cracks open the well of fluid housing the Elder Brain. As more illithids swarm into the temple, Tiberius seals the entrances to the room with stone obelisks.

This gives the party enough time to escape, Grog carrying the stone form of Kima with him. Percy, Vax, Vex, and Keyleth take shots at the Elder Brain as they leave and stay long enough to watch it reconnect with all of the illithids in the city, after being dormant so long under K'Varn's oppression. Though the brain takes some heavy damage, it is not quite enough to kill it before they are forced to leave the temple.\n "
