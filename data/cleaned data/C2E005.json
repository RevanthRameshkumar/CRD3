Caleb uses Frumpkin to scout ahead while Beau and Jester climb a tree. They don't see anything, and so continue on their way until dark.\n The group makes camp that evening about halfway to Alfield and sets up watch for the night. During the second watch, Caleb sees mysterious creatures in the distance and wakes up Nott. Nott, sneaking ahead to investigate, uses the Message cantrip to tell Caleb that they are buffalo-type creatures. Caleb is very excited and proud of her for using magic for the first time. The party expresses some interest in capturing the creatures--which are, in fact, just buffalo--but scares them off when they try to approach. Losing interest, the party then goes back to sleep.\n "

I'll just add that to the fucking list.\n Jester: If you feel like it's happening, let us know and we'll try to catch you in a jar.\n \u201d\n \u2013\n Jester to Fjord[4][!h]\n The rest of the party are very concerned for him and ask him questions about his sword, his past as a sailor, and his magical abilities. Fjord confesses that his magical abilities came to him around the same time as the the sword did, which was recently, after a trip on a merchant ship went bad. When he focuses on the sword, Fjord is able to conjure it in his open hand. When Beau and Caleb offer to take an informed look at the sword, Fjord asks to revisit the idea later.\n "

As night is falling, they come within sight of the village of Alfield in the distance and decide to push through until they reach it.\n On arrival at the outskirts of town, the party finds that Alfield is under attack and burning. A pack of gnolls is raiding the town, despite the best efforts of the local crownsguard. One of the crownsguard, seeing the party approach, offers them 30 gold a gnoll ear for their help in the fight. They agree and make their way into the fray. Dodging through and around burning buildings, the party takes down a few of the gnolls, including a couple of undead ones. Before they can do much more, however, a much larger, more ornamented gnoll lets out a signal, and the gnoll pack begins to retreat from the city along with a cart heaped with bodies. Nott goes chasing after them, followed by Molly and Beau. Seeing them give chase, the pack leader fires two arrows; the first takes down Nott, and the second, Molly. Seeing their friends go down, the rest of the party give no further chase, but Beau notes the direction the gnolls went. Jester revives the fallen Nott and Molly before they can bleed out, and the crownsguard begin to gather in the center of town to assess damages."

The gnolls, says Bryce, have raided the butcher's stock and completely cleaned out the city of meat.\n Bryce pays the party for the gnoll ears they have collected and points them toward the Feed and Mead Tavern for the night. There, Molly has a drink at the bar and a mild panic attack; Caleb sets an Alarm spell on the room and counts his gold; Jester jumps on the bed until Fjord asks her to stop; and the party eventually all goes to sleep.\n"
