They begin seeking these artifacts known as the Vestiges of the Divergence that promise ancient power from wars long passed that could aid them in this journey.\n After acquiring one[ Deathwalker's Ward] with a near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there, they begin the next step in their journey. However, as part of a recent scrying by Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to the fire elemental plane, that they normally guard, was where Thordak, the Cinder King, the great red dragon, tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most, if not all, of the tribe.\n Vox Machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside, finding it now brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the side of the mountain, you found remnants of the Pyrah tribe still alive and making their way up the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear between the prime Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire. Not just that; there was aid that came to the Pyrah tribe that involved a number of Air Ashari, one of which was Korrin, Keyleth's father. There is a brief, tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you, steeling yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of the Cindergrove \u2014the now-destroyed and -sundered petrified forest\u2014in hopes of closing this rippling tear to the Elemental Plane, once and for all.\n"
